# Company

They keep seeing them.

Somewhere between half and two thirds of bereaved people see, hear or feel the presence of the person they lost. They hold conversations. They turn to say something before they remember. It is one of the most common parts of grief and almost nobody talks about it, because they are afraid of what it means.

## Source status

This repository is a source snapshot for the standalone mod. It is not a new Workshop update or a claim that every declared game version was newly playtested. See BUILD-STATUS.md for fresh compilation results and their limits. No game assemblies, personal settings, saves or private test profiles are included.

## Build

Supply your own licensed RimWorld installation and a matching Harmony assembly. A .NET SDK is required.

For the original net472 / legacy RimWorld 1.6 project:

```powershell
./Build16.ps1 -GameDir 'PATH/TO/RIMWORLD-1.6' -HarmonyDll 'PATH/TO/1.6/0Harmony.dll'
```

For a RimWorld 1.7 build against its root-level managed API:

```powershell
./Build17.ps1 -GameDir 'PATH/TO/RIMWORLD-1.7' -HarmonyDll 'PATH/TO/1.7/0Harmony.dll'
```

The 1.7 helper writes only to `.build/1.7` inside this repository. Native validation and installation are separate steps. The 1.6 helper uses the original project and may restore its Microsoft.NETFramework reference-assemblies package from NuGet.
